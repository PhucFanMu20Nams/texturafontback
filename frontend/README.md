To clone the repository using Git, follow these steps:

1. **Install Git** (if you haven't already):

   * On macOS or Linux, you can use the terminal:

     ```bash
     git --version
     ```

     If Git is not installed, you can install it via Homebrew on macOS or using your package manager on Linux.

   * On Windows, download Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhucFanMu20Nams/textura.git
   ```

3. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   After the repository is cloned, you can navigate into the project directory using:

   ```bash
   cd textura
   ```

4. **Check the files**:
   You can verify that the repository has been cloned correctly by listing the files:

   ```bash
   ls
   ```

5. **Install dependencies** (if applicable):
   If the project requires dependencies, you can install them (for instance, if it's a Node.js project):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if it's a Python project, you might run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Now, you should have the repository cloned and ready for use! Let me know if you need further assistance.
